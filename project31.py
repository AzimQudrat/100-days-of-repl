"""Create a classic user interface using string manipulation.

Create these two user interfaces 
(below) using everything you know about 
extensions to print statements and f-strings.
The second one is a bit more tricky as it involves alignment.

There are no input statements. 
This is all about using print and variables in interesting ways. 
However, you may want to create a subroutine to 
make the color changing easier (like you did on Day 29)."""
