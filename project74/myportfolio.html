  <h2>Project 56</h2>

  <p>For day 56, we organized a dataset of the most streamed songs by creating folders for each artist and
    generating text files for their songs. This project efficiently transformed raw data into a structured format.
  </p>
  <h2>Project 61</h2>
  <a href="https://github.com/AzimQudrat/100-days-of-repl/tree/main/project61">

  </a>
  <p>For day 61, we created a simple "Twitter for one" program that lets users add and view their own tweets.
    Tweets are stored with timestamps, displayed in reverse chronological order, and shown 10 at a time, making
    it an efficient way to organize personal thoughts.
  </p>
  <h2>Project 53</h2>
  <a href="https://github.com/AzimQudrat/100-days-of-repl/blob/main/project53.py6">

  </a>
  <p>For day 53, we built a video game inventory system that allows users to add, view, and remove items.
    Items are stored in a file with auto-save and auto-load functionality. The program displays item counts,
    handles duplicates, and ensures an organized inventory experience.
  </p>
  <h2>Project 55</h2>

  <a href="https://github.com/AzimQudrat/100-days-of-repl/blob/main/project55.py">
    <img src="images/project55.JPG" width=30%>
  </a>
  <p>For day 55, we enhanced a to-do list management system by adding a backup feature. The program
    creates a "Backups" folder, generates random filenames, and saves a copy of the data before the main
    auto-save. This ensures data integrity and provides a reliable way to recover tasks if needed.
  </p>
  <h2>Project 59</h2>
  <a href="https://github.com/AzimQudrat/100-days-of-repl/tree/main/project59">
    <img src="images/project59.JPG" width=30%>
  </a>
  <p>For day 59, we created a program to check if a word is a palindrome using recursion, string slicing, and
    looping. Users input a word, and the program determines if it reads the same forward and backward, outputting
    a clear "yes" or "no" message.
