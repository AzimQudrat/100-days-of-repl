"""Today's challenge is to build a simple login system.

Your program should:

Display a menu with the ability to add a user or login.
'Add' user should:
Ask for a username and password.
Create a new password and a randomly generated 4 digit salt.
Append the salt to the password and hash it.
Store the hash and the salt in a repl db with the username as the key.
'Login' should:
Get username and password input.
Display a success message if details are correct.
This system should work with multiple users."""
#hashing function no longer works as python uses different hashes upon startup meaning this program will not work as intended
