"""Once the word has been picked, the following things need to happen:

Prompt the user to type in a letter.
Check if the letter is in the word.
If it does, output the word with all blanks apart from the letter(s) they've already guessed.
Keep a running list of the letters they've used.
Count how many times they've picked a letter that isn't in the word - more than 6 and they lose.
Output a 'win' message if they reveal all the letters.
ðŸ¥³ Extra points for using ASCII art to draw the hangman as the player makes incorrect guesses."""
