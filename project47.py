
"""Alright Top Trumpers. Your program should work like this.

Pick a category. Something popular. You know like 'most handsome computer science teachers'. ðŸ˜†
Store the information of two different objects in a 2D dictionary.
The key field should be name.
The data in the sub dictionary should be some stats about the object. For example:
Intelligence
Handsomeness
L33t c0ding skillz
Baldness level
Use an infinite loop to get the user to pick one of the two cards, then pick a stat from that card.
Display the chosen stat for both cards and output which has won.
ðŸ¥³ Extra points for:

Making the dictionary dynamic so you can add your own cards.
Using a loop to play the game in a 2 player format, keeping track of points scored."""
